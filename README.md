<strong>The things i've learned through out the days:</strong>

<strong>Challenge 1: Making a drum kit with Javascript </strong> <br />
At the start of the challenge at day 1, i've had to make a drum kit based on key events. The things i've learned during this challenge is working with key events, audio elements, javascript transition solutions and dynamically working with classes en data-attributes.

<strong> Challenge 2 Javascript clock: </strong> <br />
Challenge 2 was all about making a clock bases on the Javascript Date function. During this challenge i had to gather the time in hours, minutes and seconds and converting them into degrees. The degrees where necessary to make to clock rotate.
A nice thing i've learned was to dynamically use the converted time data and adding them to a style transform. This resulted in the clock rotating every second.

<strong>Challenge 3 Updating Css variables with Javascript: </strong> <br />
In this challenge i learned to use variables in css, working with suffixes and updating the css variables with javascript. I was really excited while learning the possibilities to dynamically adding gathering names of items i need. This resulted in a quite simple and short solution for gathering a lot of information.

<strong>Challenge 4 Array Cardio day 1: </strong> <br />
Challenge 4 was all about different ways of filtering and sorting array values. During this challenge i learned alot about how to approach arrays in multiple ways and how to setup a quick but good ES2016 function. During this challenge the short version for loops also became clearer to me, i now understand the a > b ? 1 : -1; which just means if a is greater than b return 1, else return -1. This is also a way to sort an array in alphabetical order.
