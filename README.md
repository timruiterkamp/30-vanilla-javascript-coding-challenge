30 vanilla javascript coding challenge

<strong>The things i've learned through out the days:</strong>

<strong>Challenge 1: Making a drum kit with Javascript </strong> <br />
At the start of the challenge at day 1, i've had to make a drum kit based on key events. The things i've learned during this challenge is working with key events, audio elements, javascript transition solutions and dynamically working with classes en data-attributes.

<strong> Challenge 2 Javascript clock: </strong> <br />
Challenge 2 was all about making a clock bases on the Javascript Date function. During this challenge i had to gather the time in hours, minutes and seconds and converting them into degrees. The degrees where necessary to make to clock rotate.
A nice thing i've learned was to dynamically use the converted time data and adding them to a style transform. This resulted in the clock rotating every second.

<strong>Challenge 3 Updating Css variables with Javascript: </strong> <br />
In this challenge i learned to use variables in css, working with suffixes and updating the css variables with javascript. I was really excited while learning the possibilities to dynamically adding gathering names of items i need. This resulted in a quite simple and short solution for gathering a lot of information.

<strong>Challenge 4 Array Cardio day 1: </strong> <br />
Challenge 4 was all about different ways of filtering and sorting array values. During this challenge i learned alot about how to approach arrays in multiple ways and how to setup a quick but good ES2016 function. During this challenge the short version for loops also became clearer to me, i now understand the a > b ? 1 : -1; which just means if a is greater than b return 1, else return -1. This is also a way to sort an array in alphabetical order.

<strong>Challenge 5 Flex panels image gallery: </strong> <br />
In this challenge i learned a lot about the flex property and all the possibilities of flex. In this challenge i made a flex based sort of portfolio with animations based on clicks. The javascript subject material was about making decisions based on property names and adding event listeners to trigger actions on click and transitionend.

<strong>Challenge 6 Ajax type ahead </strong> <br />
In this challenge i've learned a little bit about regex and how to fetch data out of an external source, and putting these data into useful arrays and displaying them with styling. In my opinion this one was the toughest yet, but i'm very excited to learn more about regex and putting external data to good use.

<strong>Challenge 7 Array cardio day 2 </strong> <br />
Challenge 7 was about getting familiar with the possibilities of searching, replacing, comparison or deleting items in an array.
In this challenge i've tried to get more familiar with the ES2016 function and if/else setup, this went quite well.

<strong>Challenge 8 Fun with HTML5 canvas </strong> <br />
