30 vanilla javascript coding challenge

<strong>The things i've learned through out the days:</strong>

<strong>Challenge 1: </strong> <br />
At the start of the challenge at day 1, i've had to make a drum kit based on key events. The things i've learned during this challenge is working with key events, audio elements, javascript transition solutions and dynamically working with classes en data-attributes.

<strong> Challenge 2: </strong> <br />
Challenge 2 was all about making a clock bases on the Javascript Date function. During this challenge i had to gather the time in hours, minutes and seconds and converting them into degrees. The degrees where necessary to make to clock rotate.
A nice thing i've learned was to dynamically use the converted time data and adding them to a style transform. This resulted in the clock rotating every second.

<strong>Challenge 3: </strong> <br />
