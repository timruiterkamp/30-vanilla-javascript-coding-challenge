<strong> Challenge 2 Javascript clock: </strong> <br />
Challenge 2 was all about making a clock bases on the Javascript Date function. During this challenge i had to gather the time in hours, minutes and seconds and converting them into degrees. The degrees where necessary to make to clock rotate.
A nice thing i've learned was to dynamically use the converted time data and adding them to a style transform. This resulted in the clock rotating every second.

<strong>Challenge 3 Updating Css variables with Javascript: </strong> <br />
In this challenge i learned to use variables in css, working with suffixes and updating the css variables with javascript. I was really excited while learning the possibilities to dynamically adding gathering names of items i need. This resulted in a quite simple and short solution for gathering a lot of information.
