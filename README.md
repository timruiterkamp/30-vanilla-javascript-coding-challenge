30 vanilla javascript coding challenge

<strong>The things i've learned through out the days:</strong>

<strong>Challenge 1: Making a drum kit with Javascript </strong> <br />
At the start of the challenge at day 1, i've had to make a drum kit based on key events. The things i've learned during this challenge is working with key events, audio elements, javascript transition solutions and dynamically working with classes en data-attributes.


<strong> Challenge 2 Javascript clock: </strong> <br />
Challenge 2 was all about making a clock bases on the Javascript Date function. During this challenge I had to gather the time in hours, minutes and seconds and converting them into degrees. The degrees where necessary to make to clock rotate.
A nice thing i've learned was to dynamically use the converted time data and adding them to a style transform. This resulted in the clock rotating every second.


<strong>Challenge 3 Updating Css variables with Javascript: </strong> <br />
In this challenge I learned to use variables in css, working with suffixes and updating the css variables with javascript. I was really excited while learning the possibilities to dynamically adding gathering names of items I need. This resulted in a quite simple and short solution for gathering a lot of information.


<strong>Challenge 4 Array Cardio day 1: </strong> <br />
Challenge 4 was all about different ways of filtering and sorting array values. During this challenge I learned alot about how to approach arrays in multiple ways and how to setup a quick but good ES2016 function. During this challenge the short version for loops also became clearer to me, I now understand the a > b ? 1 : -1; which just means if a is greater than b return 1, else return -1. This is also a way to sort an array in alphabetical order.


<strong>Challenge 5 Flex panels image gallery: </strong> <br />
In this challenge I learned a lot about the flex property and all the possibilities of flex. In this challenge I made a flex based sort of portfolio with animations based on clicks. The javascript subject material was about making decisions based on property names and adding event listeners to trigger actions on click and transitionend.


<strong>Challenge 6 Ajax type ahead </strong> <br />
In this challenge i've learned a little bit about regex and how to fetch data out of an external source, and putting these data into useful arrays and displaying them with styling. In my opinion this one was the toughest yet, but i'm very excited to learn more about regex and putting external data to good use.


<strong>Challenge 7 Array cardio day 2 </strong> <br />
Challenge 7 was about getting familiar with the possibilities of searching, replacing, comparison or deleting items in an array.
In this challenge i've tried to get more familiar with the ES2016 function and if/else setup, this went quite well.


<strong>Challenge 8 Fun with HTML5 canvas </strong> <br />
Challenge 8 was about making a canvas that you could draw on. During this challenge i've worked with many different aspects of the canvas drawing possibilities. A couple of methods where increasing line thickness, changing the color of the line the longer the mouse would be down and setting the right starting and end positions. In my opinion it was a really good challenge but due to the lack of experience with the canvas element it was sometimes hard to understand. I sure do have some experience to gain on this subject.


<strong>Challenge 9 14 must know dev tools tricks </strong> <br />
Challenge 9 was about some tips and tricks for the browser element inspector. The most usuable feature i've learned was the ability to check loading time of fetched data in the console and the grouping of console logs was interesting as well. Overall a nice lesson to get to know your element inspector.


<strong>Challenge 10 Hold shift to select multiple checkboxes</strong> <br />
In this challenge i've learned how to create a possibility to select multiple checkboxes at once. At first I tried it myself to see if I would come up with some kind of solution myself.. This didn't went very well, I couldn't put my thoughts into a working code. So I followed the tutorial step by step and it went more clear during the tutorial how to filter


<strong>Challenge 11 Custom HTML5 Video</strong> <br />
In this challenge I made a HTML5 based video player, it was a very fun tutorial and i've learned a lot about all the video attributes and the usage of variables as a style. The elements were new to me so it was nice to see the possibilities of the video element in combination with javascript.


<strong>Challenge 12 Key sequence detection</strong> <br />
Very fun tutorial about a sequel of the konami code. In this challenge i've got some knowledge about how to detect key sequence and convert this to a fun interaction when the key sequenced matches my secret code.


<strong>Challenge 13 Slide in on scroll</strong> <br />
This challenge was about getting images slide in on scroll. The challenge was mostly about calculating the position of images so the slide in effect could fire on the right time. It's a really helpful challenge because I will personally use this in the future for sure.


<strong>Challenge 14 Object and Arrays - Reference VS Copy</strong> <br />
This challenge was about getting to know the difference between reference and copy. This was a good challenge for me because it was a good practice of knowledge I gained from a article about Objects. Overall it was a good challenge to gain knowledge about better ways to make changes to existing code.


<strong>Challenge 15 LocalStorage and Event delegation</strong> <br />
Challenge 15 was about making a list were you could add items and store these in local storage. During this challenge the purpose of the backticks became more clear to me as did the dynamically store variables.
At the start of this challenge I did had some knowledge about local storage but not so much of the event delegation. This challenge helped a lot to make me understand event delegation. Overall it was a good challenge.


<strong>Challenge 16 Mouse move shadow</strong> <br />
this challenge was about creating text shadows that moved upon the mouse position. The creation of the text shadow based on x and y math was new to me but I experienced it as a fun challenge. Again the backticks were used to create a dynamic style that changed upon mouse movements.


<strong>Challenge 17 Sorting Band Names without articles</strong> <br />
Very nice and shot challenge, I tried it myself at first but didn't felt all confident while doing it. Then I followed the tutorial and it was not all that weird for me to not feel confident due to the fact regex was needed for a good sorting, and I am not experienced with it. After following the tutorial Wes did some good explanation about the regex and I really like it when it cuts down code to es2016 codes. But after this challenge I know for sure I have some further training to do with regex. Overall a nice challenge again.


 <strong>Challenge 18 Tally String Times with Reduce</strong> <br />
 In this challenge I had to figure how many hours, minutes and seconds of video Wes had uploaded. In this challenge I came across how to calculate how much is left after u ran Math.floor() on a calculation. With the % u can see how much will be left after the calculation has been equally distributed. For example if u have 11 sweets for 5 kids (11 / 5) the result will return 2.2, but u can't just give all the kids .2 of a sweet. With the % method the outcome will be 2 + 1 left (for dad). The % calculates how many kids can get a flat number and how much will be left after every kid has the flat amount of sweets and the result is that there will be 1 left. Overall a very good challenge with great explanation.


<strong>Challenge 19 Unreal webcam fun</strong> <br />
Challenge 19 was about creating a sort of webcam fun booth were you could change filters to give a fun look to the webcam livestream. In this challenge I learned about the structure of images and how to manipulate the rgba values to create some cool filters. It was a quite long and though challenge where I have to look back at in the future for sure, overall a very cool challenge that was great fun to make.


 <strong>Challenge 20 Native Speech Recognition</strong> <br />
 In challenge 20 I built a native speech recognition. I was very confused that it was so easy to use speech recognition and it wasn't even as complicated to put together as I thought. It was great fun to see what you just said and that the browser recongized if you stopped talking or not so it could make a new sentence. During this challenge the .map function came up as it also did in the latest challenge, I'm glad this gets repeated alot because I get the feeling I start to understand it better and better with each challenge. Some new things I wasn't that familiar with was appendChild, but at the end of the challenge it just puts it value to the given attribute.


<strong>Challenge 21 Geolocation based Speedometer and Compass</strong> <br />
This was a very short challenge based on updating speed and a compass on coordinates. In this challenge there was some short talk about the .textContent what means that the value will be put on screen. Next to the textContent there was a dynamic update on position of the compass that has been made possible with the use of backticks and the information out of the object.


<strong>Challenge 22 Follow Along Links</strong> <br />
In this challenge the purpose was to create a hover element that would trigger if the mouse moves over a link. During this challenge I got the feeling I started to get why you would build up the code in the structure the tutorial did and I understood why and how I could make good use of objects and the elements I put in the object. Till now I just followed the tutorials and tried to understand how the code worked and why it was built this way, by now I also get the feeling I understand it. This is also funded by the articles I've read such as: http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-objects-in-detail/, http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/ and http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/.


<strong>Challenge 23 Speech Synthesis</strong> <br />
During this challenge I made a speech synthesis where multiple pre installed voices could say the words I typed. Not only they could speak the written words but the speed rate of the voice and the pitch could be turned up and down for some funny sounding voices. This was yet another fun challenge to do, the only thing I notice is that I personally would not always come up with suggestions Wes does come up with. But that's part of the proces.


<strong>Challenge 24 Sticky Nav</strong> <br />
This challenge was about creating a stick navigation. This was a very helpful challenge because I've used this many times in way more complicated ways then Wes learned me in this challenge. Just with the adding of some simple classes and dynamic offsets the transition of the sticky nav went very smooth. Learned some very helpful things with a minimal amount of code.


<strong>Challenge 25 Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling and Once</strong> <br />
This was a nice challenge about understanding what causes event bubbling and how to stop this. This challenge was a good tutorial of the articles I've read: http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-with-ease/ and http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/.


<strong>Challenge 26 Stripe Follow Along Dropdown</strong> <br />
Really cool challenge about making a dropdown based on an existing dropdown variant on the website of Stripe. It was cool to make a menu that had a quite clean look & feel due to the little animations in the hovers. Overall a good tutorial again and I finally could sort of type ahead at for example the coordinates and dynamic css. It felt good to just type ahead without looking at the pre written code in the tutorial and have to search for the right way of spelling etc.


<strong>Challenge 27 Click and Drag to Scroll</strong> <br />
Short but good tutorial about mouse events and how to create a click and drag scroll section. The code was not hard to understand when he showed it, but to make it myself it was still kinda tricky to get the right data for the calculations.


<strong>Challenge 28 Video speed controller UI</strong> <br />
In this challenge we controlled the speed of the video by a top to bottom range, the range is controllable by hovering your mouse over the percentage you like and the video will automatically speed up or down. The code wasn't that hard to understand cause we've executed this same sort of code now for a couple of tutorials after each other, but it is still a great way to practice.


<strong>Challenge 29 Video speed controller UI</strong> <br />
Challenge 29 was about making a countdown clock, it was a good exercise with a lot of math in it to calculate al the seconds, minutes and hours. The outcome is maybe come in handy later on as it is a good timer and very effective. Through this challenge I learned some more about the setInterval, callbacks and Date().


<strong>Challenge 30 Whack a Mole Game</strong> <br />
The final challenge was about creating a whack a mole game. During this challenge it was mostly about creating actions based on click events and giving the user a reaction on a successful try by updating the scoreboard. Overall it was yet again it really awesome challenge and it's kinda sad that this was the last one of the series. They were great fun to follow/complete.


<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
The challenge in combination with articles on the following web page: http://javascriptissexy.com/16-javascript-concepts-you-must-know-well/ , made me get more knowledge about the possibilities of Javascript and I feel like i grew a lot the past months based on how I struggled with understanding the code in the beginning. I really recommend doing this challenge because besides the fun it is a great way to get better at Javascript.
